             Simple pubsub-based IP banning engine. Subscribes to a ban publisher, bans the IPs and then unbans them
             after a configured time period. Designed to work in concert with

        <p class="description">
            A utility for bundling resources in web pages into a single page by inlining them using the data URI scheme.

            It is designed to be easy to use in all kinds of scenarios, ranging from ones where one simply wants to
            produce a web page with certain resources bundled to scenarios where one would like to proxy resource
            requests, include caching functionality, modify request headers, and more.

        <p class="description">
          A service for proxying requests via bundler, with support
          for remapping based on host header and other features for
          encapsulating and providing access to bundled content.

        <p class="description">
            Edgemanage is a tool for managing the HTTP availability of a cluster of web servers via DNS. The machines
            tested are expected to be at risk of large volumes of traffic, attack or other potential instability. If a
            machine is found to be underperforming, it is replace by a more performant host to ensure maximum
            availability.

        <p class="description">
          Learn2ban is a machine learning anti-DDoS tool. It
          uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">support
          vector machines</a> to learn about HTTP traffic access
          patterns and then use this information to determine when
          attacks and happening and how.

        <p class="description">
          A tool for using the data generated by Learn2Ban to actively
          classify incoming traffic and use the generated
          classifications to determine whether user activity is a
          malicious bot or a legitimate access. Runs on edges in
          tandem with Banjax and Swabber. Soon to be reimplemented as
          part of Banjax.
