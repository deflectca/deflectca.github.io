        <p class="description">
            A utility for bundling resources in web pages into a single page by inlining them using the data URI scheme.

            It is designed to be easy to use in all kinds of scenarios, ranging from ones where one simply wants to
            produce a web page with certain resources bundled to scenarios where one would like to proxy resource
            requests, include caching functionality, modify request headers, and more.

        <p class="description">
            Edgemanage is a tool for managing the HTTP availability of a cluster of web servers via DNS. The machines
            tested are expected to be at risk of large volumes of traffic, attack or other potential instability. If a
            machine is found to be underperforming, it is replace by a more performant host to ensure maximum
            availability.
